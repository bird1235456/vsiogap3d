3D Visualisation of Sensor Information on Google Android Platform
=================================================================

This is a repository containing the work I have done for my Bachelor of Engineering thesis back in 2009 at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK.

The aim of the project was to visualize, in semi-real-time, the state of a building on an Android phone. This was back in the times of Android 1.1, when the only available device was the T-Mobile G1.

The code has not been touched since mid-2009, so this is mostly a historical reference. I've had to move it over from Google Code, since it's shutting down.

I hope this will be useful to someone :) Please let me know if you like it.

Thanks,
Maciej
